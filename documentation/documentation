### BCCTBbp: Breast Cancer Campaign Tissue Bank bioinformatics portal

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4384036/pdf/gku984.pdf

BCCTBbp  is  dedicated  to  maximising  research  on  patient  tissues

- stores  genomics,  methylomics,  transcriptomics,  proteomics  and  microRNA  data

- these have been mined from literature
- allows researchers to pose new questions and link them to  pathways  and mechanisms  involved  in  breast  cancer.

Currently, the  portal  holds  146  datasets and contains over  227, 795  expression genomic  measurements  from  various breast tissues (e.g. normal, malignant or benign lesions), cell lines and body fluids.

- Has a dedicated analytical layer allowing researchers to further analyse stored datasets

Aim of this project is to work on this aspect and further develop and enhance the integrated analytical layers to facilitate tailored analysis of key datasets, thus allowing users to pose questions not addressed in the original publications simply and efficiently.


## Analytical Options

Four analysis categories can be performed: 

### Molecular Classification
Each of the included dataset samples can be classified based on
- the PAM50 set of markers
- OR the hormonal receptor status can be inferred from the transcriptome using the MCLUST R package (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mclust/)
### Tumour Purity
Cancer samples frequently contain a small proportion of normal adjacent tissue that might confuse sample analysis. A method to infer sample cancer purity is implemented using ESTIMATE
### Gene Expression
Gene expression plots can be obtained for a gene of interest
### Survival
For datasets that contain patient survival information, survival analysis can be performed using the ‘survival’ package in R (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/)

Two modes are available
- survival based on sample sub-groups within the dataset
- OR survival based on the expression value of a gene of interest

In the gene-based survival analysis, two classes of gene expression values (high and low) are determined based on the median expression value.

# Pancreatic Expression Database

We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of pancreatic cancer-expression space by integrating data from otherwise disparate studies. Currently, the most comprehensive analysis of pancreatic cancer to date, our study primarily serves to highlight limitations inherent with a lack of raw data availability, insufficient clinical/histopathological information and ambiguous data processing. It stresses the importance of a global-systems approach to assess and maximise findings from expression profiling of malignant and non-malignant diseases.The results of this meta-analysis are freely available and can be queried and visualised below.

Pipeline information

# The Cancer Genome Atlas

# Pipeline Options

### [1] MuTect2
* Applies Bayesian classifier to detect somatic mutations with very low allele 
 fractions and requires only a few supporting reads however is confounded by 
 low tumor purity.
* Has high sensitivity and calls mutations with allelic fractions as low as 
 0.1 and below.
* Low specifiticity.
* Applies carefully tuned hard filters to compensate for specificity issues.

### [2] Varscan2
* Is generally outperformed by MuSE and MuTect2.
* Low sensitivity and fails to pick up somatic SNVs of low allelic fraction
 as supresses mutations below allelic threshold.
* Sensitivity can be improved but this drastically drops specificitiy and 
 returns high levels of false positives.
* Outperformed MuTect to identify variants present at 10%, 5%, 2.5% and 1%
 at sequencing depths of 100x, 250x, 500x and 1000x respectively.
* See (Stead et al, 2013).
* However, Varscan2 circumvents confounding factor of tumor purity and extreme
 read depth as does not use probabilistic framework to detect variants and
 assess confidence in them but uses a robust heuristic/statistic approach to 
 call variants that meet desired thresholds for read depth, base quality, 
 variant allele frequency, and statistical significance.

### [3] MuSE
* Has outperformed MuTect2 on calling variants from ACC TCGA data.
 * Maximum likelihood or the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method estimates 
 Model parameters. 
* Variants are classified into somatic, germ-line, and reversal to the 
 homozygous reference by comparing the somatic variant allele fraction (π) 
 between the paired tumor–normal samples.
* A sample-specific error model to account for tumor heterogeneity and 
 identify cutoffs is built.
* Filters reduce the number of false positives by considering the sequence 
 context surrounding the point mutations. 

### [4] SomaticSniper
* Returns high level of false positives and many of these are not in agreement 
 with other InDel callers.
* Most of the literature shows it is outperformed by most other variant callers.

## Verdict
* TCGA-BRCA analysis is suitable with either Mutect2 or MuSE. Ideally both 
 hould be run and the results correlated / contrasted.
* TCGA-PAAD analysis would only be advisable with Varscan2 due to significantly
 low tumor purity (circa 40%).

# initial investigation

Obtain mutations data from TCGA (breast or pancreatic)

play around with R analysis

need to subset data to obtain top hit dif gene expression + genes of interest to end-user

## Identifying useful subsets
## all the subsets available are:

### useful
- race = useful states if "black or african american" or "white" or "asian"
- year_of_birth = very useful
- bcr_patient_barcode = very useful (but is it the same as submitter Id?)
- disease = it's all just BRCA, i guess it confirms you picked the right group since this will be soft coded
- gender = very useful, mostly female but some male (can see data trends possibly)
- tissue_or_organ_of_origin = seems a better indictator than site of biopsy (mainly c50.9)
- morphology = gives cancer morphology codes (e.g. 8520/3), seems seems quite useful
- vital_status = seems very useful, states if patient is alive or dead
- tumor_stage = very useful (stage i, ii, iii etc.)


### Not useful
- submitter_id = appears to be identical to the patient barcode value
- last_known_disease_status = all not reported
- classification_of_tumor = not reported
- primary_diagnosis = not sure why these are all c50.9 since tissue of origin is varied
- updated_datetime = seems irrelevent
- age_at_diagnosis = seems to be not useful in this context
- days_to_death = seems to actually be days SINCE death, mostly NA, not useful
- days_to_last_follow_up = seems a bit irrelevent especially since many are dead
- state = all NA
- days_to_last_known_disease_status = all NA
- days_to_recurrence = all NA
- tumour grade = all not reported
- diagnosis_id = seems a bit irrelevent
- treatments (Ids) = patient barcode with another code, seems a bit irrelevent
- site_of_resection_or_biopsy = possibly useful (majority are c50.9) but tissue of origin is better
- days_to_birth = irrelevent
- ethnicity = it's all either "(not) hispanic or latino" or "not reported"
- year_of_death = kind of useful
- demographic_id = seems a bit irrelevent
- progression_or_recurrence = all not reported
- prior_malignancy = all not reported
- created_datetime = all NA
- alcohol_intensity = it's a shame this is all NA as would be relevent
- alcohol_history = it's a shame this is all NA as it would be relevent
- bmi = it's a shame this is all NA as would be relevent
- weight = it's a shame this is all NA as would be relevent
- cigarettes_per_day = it's a shame this is all NA as would be relevent
- height = all NA so useless here
- years_smoked = all NA so also useless for BRCA data
- exposure_id = unsure of the significance of this

## Paper summaries

### TCGA Workflow: Analyze cancer genomics and epigenomics data using Bioconductor packages

https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1542/v1

### TCGAbiolinks: an R/Bioconductor package for integrative analysis of TCGA data

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4856967/

TCGA is a large collection of clinical and molecular phenotypes of more than 10 000 tumor patients across 33 different tumor types. 

From this, TCGA has published over 20 marker papers detailing the genomic and epigenomic alterations associated with these tumor types. 

Implementing novel methods can elucidate new biological pathways and diagnostic markers. 

Mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics challenges, like data retrieval and integration with clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA methylation).

An R/Bioconductor package was developed (TCGAbiolinks) to address these challenges and offer bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of TCGA data.

Four different TCGA tumor types (Kidney, Brain, Breast and Colon) were ued as case studies to illustrate examples of reproducibility, integrative analysis and utilization of different Bioconductor packages to advance and accelerate novel discoveries.

# Cancer Genomics from Discovery science to Personalised Medicine

http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v17/n3/full/nm.2323.html

development of genomics has turned cancer medicine from morphology-based to genetics-based taxonomy.
increasingly customised care for patient depending on proteomics and genomics of tumour.
personalised medicine is a maturing reality and no longer fantasy
level of genomic complexity is far beyond expectations: practical utilisation of genetic information is unrealised in medicine
2 main challenges causing slow down in translation from science to medicine:
1. incomplete catalogue of genomic alterations
2. lack of understanding of how alterations affect pathways / signal transduction / what the biological consequences are etc.
- hard to obtain this as specific assays are not always available + cancer context is very complex and hard to identify which driver events cause what (as intertwined)...

this paper highlights importance of biological significance and how personalised medicine is achivable.

first cancer mutation discovered HRAS gene gly12 to val12, then others (KRAS, NRAS) discovered: this ushered in cancer genomics study

RAS proteins are important for transduction of proliferation and survival
- after 30 years of trying to inhibit it unsuccessfully, only NOW is being used as some kind of marker...
mutant cancer genes can be targets for therapy

most early efforts for cancer genetics research focused on druggable targets (protein/lipid kinases)
V600 mutation linked to BRAF mutation (kinase central to MAPK cascade, transduces growth factors via RAS proteins to phosphorylate MEK proteins)
BRAF inhibition was developed after 8 years; effective in tumours with V600E mutation
PIK3 is most commonly mutated gene in breast cancer: drives AKT signalling for growth and stability
