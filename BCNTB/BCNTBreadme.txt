BCCTBbp
Breast Cancer Campaign Tissue Bank bioinformatics portal

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4384036/pdf/gku984.pdf

BCCTBbp  is  dedicated  to  maximising  research  on  patient  tissues

- stores  genomics,  methylomics,  transcriptomics,  proteomics  and  microRNA  data

- these have been mined from literature
- allows researchers to pose new questions and link them to  pathways  and mechanisms  involved  in  breast  cancer.

Currently, the  portal  holds  146  datasets and contains over  227, 795  expression genomic  measurements  from  various breast tissues (e.g. normal, malignant or benign lesions), cell lines and body fluids.

- Has a dedicated analytical layer allowing researchers to further analyse stored datasets

Aim of this project is to work on this aspect and further develop and enhance the integrated analytical layers to facilitate tailored analysis of key datasets, thus allowing users to pose questions not addressed in the original publications simply and efficiently.
