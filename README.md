# Oncomatic: the TCGA query tool

Developed as part of MSc Bioinformatics Project at QMUL-BCI, 2017.
Supervisor(s): Dr Claude Chelala, Dr Emanuela Gadaleta, Dr Jacek Marzec, Bioinformatics Unit, Barts Cancer Institute

## Project Summary:

The Breast Cancer Now Tissue Bank (BCNTB) and the Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund Tissue Bank (PCRFTB) are two vital resources that support and promote cutting-edge research by providing access to high-quality and fully annotated tissues. Each Tissue Bank hosts specialised bioinformatics resources (BCNTB:bioinformatics portal and the Pancreatic Expression Database) from which the research community can access information about genomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and microRNA data that has been mined from the literature and link them to pathways and mechanisms involved in breast/pancreatic cancer.

We are in the process of enhancing our integrated analytical layers to facilitate tailored analysis of key datasets, thus allowing users to pose questions not addressed in the original publications simply and efficiently.

This project aims to expand the options available within the analytical framework of these bioinformatic tools and investigate means to enhance the presentation of results currently available. 



## Aims and objectives

In order to improve BCNTB and the PED we must:

### 1.) Utilise TCGA
- Develop an analytical framework to access, download and query sequencing and mutation data
 - Sequencing data will be analysed by differential expression analysis to identify the most variable genes between user-defined biological conditions and present these in tabular and graphical format
 - Mutation data will be analysed to identify the top mutated genes between user-defined biological conditions and present these in tabular and graphical format

### 2.) Improve the visualisation / graphical options available in the BCNTB:bp (and PED if enough time)
